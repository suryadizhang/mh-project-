# MyHibachi Zero-Downtime Deployment Script
# Location: /usr/local/bin/deploy_myhibachi.sh
# 
# This script performs a rolling deployment across all backend instances,
# ensuring zero downtime by restarting one instance at a time and verifying
# health before proceeding to the next.
# 
# Usage:
#   sudo /usr/local/bin/deploy_myhibachi.sh
# 
# Prerequisites:
#   - Git repository configured in backend directory
#   - Python virtual environment at .venv/
#   - Systemd services: myhibachi-backend@1, @2, @3
# 
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - Deployment failed (instance didn't start)
#   2 - Git pull failed
#   3 - Dependency installation failed
#   4 - Migration failed

set -e  # Exit on error
set -u  # Exit on undefined variable
set -o pipefail  # Exit on pipe failure
