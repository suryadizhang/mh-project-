**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Current Status**: ✅ PHASE 2B Complete (Blog Migration)  
**Build Status**: ✅ Production Ready

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Today - 2 hours)

### **1. Development Testing** (30 minutes)
```bash
cd apps/customer
npm run dev
```

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3000/blog
- [ ] Verify all 84 posts display
- [ ] Click on individual blog posts
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test filters (category, serviceArea, eventType)
- [ ] Verify author names display correctly
- [ ] Check API route responses in Network tab

### **2. Bundle Size Measurement** (15 minutes)
```bash
cd apps/customer
npm run build

# Check bundle sizes
ls -lh .next/static/chunks/
```

**Compare**:
- Before: ~2,255 KB (blogPosts.ts in bundle)
- Expected: ~170 KB (MDX not bundled)
- Expected reduction: ~2,085 KB (-92%)

### **3. Performance Testing** (30 minutes)
- API route response times (should be <200ms)
- Blog homepage load time
- Individual post load time
- Lighthouse scores

### **4. Final Documentation** (45 minutes)
- [ ] Update GRAND_EXECUTION_PLAN.md (mark PHASE 2B complete)
- [ ] Update FIXES_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- [ ] Create workflow guide for adding new MDX posts
- [ ] Document any findings from testing
