## üìû Having Trouble?

### Can't find the webhook secret?
- Make sure you clicked on the webhook endpoint (not just viewing the list)
- Look for "Signing secret" section
- Click "Reveal" to see it

### Not sure if you're in test mode?
- Look at top-right corner of Stripe dashboard
- Should say "Viewing test data"
- If it says "Viewing live data", click it to toggle

### Backend still won't start?
Run this to check your config:
```bash
cd apps/backend
python -c "from src.core.config import get_settings; s = get_settings(); print('Config OK!')"
```

**Start with just the Stripe webhook - you can add other APIs later if needed!** üöÄ
