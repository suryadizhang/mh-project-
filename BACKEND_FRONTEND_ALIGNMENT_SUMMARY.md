## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Analytics Dashboard Backend Missing ❌
**Impact:** Dashboard will crash on load  
**Affected:** 6 endpoints called by analytics page don't exist  
**Fix Time:** 2 hours (quick fix) OR 1 week (proper fix)  

```
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/overview
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/leads
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/newsletter
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/funnel
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/lead-scoring
❌ GET /api/admin/analytics/engagement-trends
```

**Recommendation:** Use existing analytics endpoints temporarily:
- ✅ `/api/stripe/analytics/payments` (works)
- ✅ `/api/reviews/admin/analytics` (works)
- ✅ `/api/analytics/bookings` (test endpoint, works)

---

### 2. Inbox Features Not Connected ⚠️
**Impact:** Users can't reply to messages or convert leads  
**Affected:** 3 placeholder functions in inbox  
**Fix Time:** 2 hours  

```javascript
// Current (Placeholder)
async respondToThread(threadId, message) {
  return { success: true, message: "Mock response" }; // ❌
}

// Should Be (Real API)
async respondToThread(threadId, message) {
  return api.post(`/api/leads/social-threads/${threadId}/respond`, { message }); // ✅
}
```

**Files to Fix:**
- `apps/admin/src/services/api.ts` - `socialService.respondToThread`
- `apps/admin/src/services/api.ts` - `socialService.convertThreadToLead`
- `apps/admin/src/app/inbox/page.tsx` - Message send handler

---

### 3. Review Resolution Incomplete ⚠️
**Impact:** Can't resolve escalated reviews  
**Affected:** 2 placeholder functions  
**Fix Time:** 1 hour  

```javascript
// Fix These
reviewService.resolveReview(reviewId, resolution) // ❌ Placeholder
reviewService.issueAICoupon(reviewId) // ❌ Placeholder
```
