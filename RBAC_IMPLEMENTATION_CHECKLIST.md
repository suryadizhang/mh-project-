## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] **CRITICAL: Backup database** 
  ```bash
  pg_dump -h host -U user -d myhibachi_crm > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
  ```

- [ ] **Update super admin emails**
  - File: `apps/backend/src/db/migrations/alembic/versions/008_add_user_roles.py`
  - Lines: 30-35
  - Add your admin email addresses

- [ ] **Test on staging environment first**

### Migration Steps

- [ ] **1. Connect to PostgreSQL database**
  ```bash
  export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/myhibachi_crm"
  ```

- [ ] **2. Check current migration status**
  ```bash
  cd apps/backend
  alembic current
  alembic heads  # Should show 3 heads
  ```

- [ ] **3. Run merge migration**
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade 06fc7e9891b1  # Merge migration
  ```

- [ ] **4. Run RBAC migrations**
  ```bash
  alembic upgrade head
  ```
  
  Expected output:
  ```
  INFO  [alembic] Running upgrade -> 006, create audit logs system
  INFO  [alembic] Running upgrade 006 -> 007, add soft delete support
  INFO  [alembic] Running upgrade 007 -> 008, add user roles
  ```

- [ ] **5. Verify migrations succeeded**
  ```bash
  alembic current  # Should show 008_add_user_roles
  ```

### Post-Migration Verification

- [ ] **Check audit_logs table exists**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM audit_logs LIMIT 1;
  ```

- [ ] **Check soft delete columns exist**
  ```sql
  \d bookings
  -- Should show: deleted_at, deleted_by, delete_reason
  ```

- [ ] **Check user roles assigned**
  ```sql
  SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;
  ```
  
  Expected output:
  ```
  SUPER_ADMIN      | 2
  ADMIN            | 3
  CUSTOMER_SUPPORT | 45
  ```

- [ ] **Verify super admins set correctly**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'SUPER_ADMIN';
  ```

### Backend Testing

- [ ] **Test DELETE endpoint with curl**
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://api.example.com/bookings/{booking_id} \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"reason": "Customer requested cancellation due to weather concerns"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Expected success response (200)**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Booking deleted successfully",
    "booking_id": "abc-123",
    "deleted_at": "2025-10-28T15:30:00Z",
    "deleted_by": "user-xyz789",
    "restore_until": "2025-11-27T15:30:00Z"
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Test missing reason (422)**
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://api.example.com/bookings/{booking_id} \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{}'
  ```

- [ ] **Test short reason (400)**
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://api.example.com/bookings/{booking_id} \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"reason": "Test"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Test unauthorized user (403)**
  ```bash
  # Use token from user without CUSTOMER_SUPPORT role
  curl -X DELETE http://api.example.com/bookings/{booking_id} \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer STATION_MANAGER_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"reason": "Should fail with 403"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Verify audit log created**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
  WHERE resource_type = 'booking' 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 1;
  ```

- [ ] **Verify soft delete worked**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, deleted_at, deleted_by, delete_reason 
  FROM bookings 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL 
  ORDER BY deleted_at DESC 
  LIMIT 1;
  ```

### Frontend Deployment

- [ ] **Deploy DeleteConfirmationModal component**
  ```bash
  # Verify file exists
  ls apps/admin/src/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx
  ```

- [ ] **Deploy usePermissions hook**
  ```bash
  ls apps/admin/src/hooks/usePermissions.ts
  ```

- [ ] **Deploy RequireRole component**
  ```bash
  ls apps/admin/src/components/RequireRole.tsx
  ```

- [ ] **Build and deploy frontend**
  ```bash
  cd apps/admin
  npm run build
  # Deploy to hosting
  ```

### Frontend Testing

- [ ] **Test DeleteConfirmationModal opens**
  - Navigate to booking management
  - Click delete button
  - Modal should appear

- [ ] **Test character counter**
  - Type in textarea
  - Counter should update (e.g., "490 characters remaining")
  - Red warning when < 50 chars remaining

- [ ] **Test validation**
  - Confirm button disabled with < 10 chars
  - Confirm button disabled without checkbox
  - Confirm button enabled with valid reason + checkbox

- [ ] **Test submission**
  - Fill valid reason (10+ chars)
  - Check confirmation checkbox
  - Click "Confirm Delete"
  - Loading spinner should appear
  - Success: Modal closes, booking removed
  - Error: Error message displays in modal

- [ ] **Test keyboard shortcuts**
  - ESC key closes modal
  - Enter key submits (when valid)

- [ ] **Test permission-based visibility**
  - Login as SUPER_ADMIN: Delete button visible
  - Login as ADMIN: Delete button visible
  - Login as CUSTOMER_SUPPORT: Delete button visible
  - Login as STATION_MANAGER: Delete button hidden (or restricted to own station)

### Security Audit

- [ ] **Verify RBAC enforcement**
  - Non-admin cannot delete bookings (403)
  - Station manager cannot delete other station bookings (403)
  - Unauthenticated requests rejected (401)

- [ ] **Verify audit logging**
  - All deletions logged to audit_logs table
  - WHO: user_id, role, name, email captured
  - WHAT: action, resource_type, resource_id captured
  - WHEN: created_at timestamp captured
  - WHERE: ip_address, user_agent captured
  - WHY: delete_reason captured
  - DETAILS: old_values captured

- [ ] **Verify soft delete**
  - Deleted items have deleted_at timestamp
  - Deleted items have deleted_by user_id
  - Deleted items have delete_reason
  - Deleted items still in database (not permanently deleted)

- [ ] **Verify 30-day restore window**
  - Items deleted < 30 days ago can be restored
  - Items deleted > 30 days ago auto-purged (implement cron job)

### Performance Check

- [ ] **Check audit_logs table size**
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('audit_logs'));
  ```

- [ ] **Check audit_logs indexes**
  ```sql
  SELECT indexname, indexdef 
  FROM pg_indexes 
  WHERE tablename = 'audit_logs';
  ```
  
  Should show 8 indexes

- [ ] **Check query performance**
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
  SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
  WHERE user_id = 'some-uuid' 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 20;
  ```
  
  Should use idx_audit_logs_user_created index

### Monitoring

- [ ] **Set up audit log monitoring**
  - Alert on DELETE actions > 100/day
  - Alert on failed DELETE attempts (403/401)
  - Track audit_logs table growth

- [ ] **Set up soft delete monitoring**
  - Count deleted items per day
  - Alert on unusual deletion spikes
  - Track items approaching 30-day purge

- [ ] **Set up RBAC monitoring**
  - Track role distribution
  - Alert on new SUPER_ADMIN assignments
  - Monitor failed permission checks

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Multiple head revisions"
**Solution:** Run merge migration first
```bash
alembic upgrade 06fc7e9891b1
alembic upgrade head
```

### Issue: "near 'SCHEMA': syntax error"
**Cause:** Running on SQLite instead of PostgreSQL  
**Solution:** Use PostgreSQL (see MIGRATION_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md)

### Issue: "Column already exists"
**Cause:** Migration ran partially  
**Solution:**
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
alembic upgrade head
```

### Issue: "No audit logs appearing"
**Possible causes:**
1. Migration not run (check with `SELECT * FROM audit_logs`)
2. audit_logger not imported (check imports in bookings.py)
3. Function not called (check delete_booking implementation)

**Debug:**
```python
# Add logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info(f"About to log deletion: {booking_id}")
```

### Issue: "403 Forbidden for admin user"
**Possible causes:**
1. User role not set correctly (check `SELECT role FROM users WHERE id = '...'`)
2. Role not in allowed roles (check Permission.BOOKING_DELETE)
3. Token stale (logout and login again)

**Debug:**
```python
# Add logging in require_customer_support()
logger.info(f"User role: {current_user.get('role')}")
logger.info(f"Allowed roles: {allowed_roles}")
```
