# Phase 9: Advanced Security & Production Hardening

## üéØ Phase 9 Objectives

Building on Phase 8's performance monitoring foundation, Phase 9 focuses on advanced security hardening and production-ready deployment preparation.

### Core Objectives

1. **Advanced Security Audit & Hardening**
   - Comprehensive security vulnerability assessment
   - Enhanced CSP (Content Security Policy) optimization
   - Security headers validation and strengthening
   - Authentication & authorization security review

2. **Production Deployment Hardening**
   - Environment-specific configuration validation
   - SSL/TLS certificate preparation
   - Load balancer and CDN readiness assessment
   - Database security and backup strategy

3. **API Security Enhancement**
   - API endpoint security review
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CORS policy optimization

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - CI/CD pipeline security review
   - Secrets management audit
   - Container security (if applicable)
   - Monitoring and alerting for security events

5. **Compliance & Documentation**
   - Security compliance checklist
   - Incident response preparation
   - Security documentation updates
   - Penetration testing readiness
