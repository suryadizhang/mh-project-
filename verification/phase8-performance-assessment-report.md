# Phase 8: Performance Assessment Sweep - EXECUTION REPORT

## Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Overview

Comprehensive performance analysis to identify and optimize
bottlenecks, ensure fast loading times, and deliver an excellent user
experience. This phase measures and improves Core Web Vitals, bundle
sizes, rendering performance, and overall application speed.

## Phase 8 Checklist:

- [ ] Core Web Vitals assessment (LCP, CLS, FID)
- [ ] Bundle size analysis and optimization
- [ ] Image optimization verification
- [ ] JavaScript performance profiling
- [ ] CSS optimization assessment
- [ ] Network performance analysis
- [ ] Caching strategy evaluation
- [ ] Lazy loading implementation check
- [ ] Server-side rendering optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization (if applicable)
- [ ] Third-party script performance impact
- [ ] Mobile performance validation
