---

## üîê Authentication

All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     https://api.myhibachi.com/stations
```

**Permissions Required**:
- **Create**: `manage_stations` (super admin only)
- **Read**: `view_stations` (all roles)
- **Update**: `manage_stations` (super admin or station admin for own station)
- **Delete**: `manage_stations` (super admin only)

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Station Code Examples

The system auto-generates codes in this format:

```
STATION-{STATE}-{CITY}-{###}
```

**Real Examples**:
- `STATION-CA-BAY-001` - California Bay Area (1st)
- `STATION-CA-BAY-002` - California Bay Area (2nd)
- `STATION-TX-AUSTIN-001` - Texas Austin (1st)
- `STATION-FL-MIAMI-001` - Florida Miami (1st)
- `STATION-NY-MANHATTAN-001` - New York Manhattan (1st)

**City Normalization**:
- "Bay Area" ‚Üí `BAY`
- "San Francisco" ‚Üí `SAN`
- "Austin" ‚Üí `AUSTIN`
- "New York City" ‚Üí `NEW` or `NYC`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete Safety Rules

### Hard Blocks (Cannot delete without force=true)
- ‚ùå Active bookings (status: pending, confirmed, in_progress)
- ‚ùå Assigned users (is_active: true)

### Warnings (Shows warning, allows deletion)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Historical bookings (status: completed, cancelled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inactive users (is_active: false)

### Force Delete (Super Admin Only)
```bash
DELETE /api/stations/{id}?force=true
```
- Bypasses all safety checks
- Creates detailed audit log entry
- Irreversible - use with caution!

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Create and List
```bash
# Create a station
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/stations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Station",
    "display_name": "MyHibachi - Test",
    "city": "TestCity",
    "state": "CA",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }'

# List all stations
curl http://localhost:8000/api/stations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Test 2: Update Station
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/stations/{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "maintenance"}'
```

### Test 3: Delete (Safety Check)
```bash
# Will fail if bookings/users exist
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/stations/{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Force delete
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/stations/{id}?force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## üìä Station Statuses

| Status | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `active` | Fully operational | Normal operations |
| `inactive` | Temporarily closed | Seasonal closure |
| `suspended` | Admin suspended | Compliance issues |
| `maintenance` | Under maintenance | System upgrades |

---

## üîÑ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Opening a New Location

```bash
# 1. Create station (auto-generates code)
POST /api/stations
{
  "name": "Florida Miami",
  "city": "Miami",
  "state": "FL",
  ...
}

# Response: STATION-FL-MIAMI-001

# 2. Assign station manager
POST /api/stations/{id}/users
{
  "user_id": "manager-uuid",
  "role": "station_admin"
}

# 3. Configure business hours
PUT /api/stations/{id}
{
  "business_hours": {...}
}

# 4. Set status to active
PUT /api/stations/{id}
{
  "status": "active"
}
```

### Workflow 2: Closing a Station

```bash
# 1. Set status to inactive
PUT /api/stations/{id}
{
  "status": "inactive"
}

# 2. Reassign users to other stations
POST /api/stations/{new-station-id}/users
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "role": "station_admin"
}

# 3. Complete all bookings
# (handle via booking management)

# 4. Delete station (when safe)
DELETE /api/stations/{id}
```

### Workflow 3: Temporary Maintenance

```bash
# 1. Set to maintenance mode
PUT /api/stations/{id}
{
  "status": "maintenance"
}

# 2. After maintenance complete
PUT /api/stations/{id}
{
  "status": "active"
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Only super administrators can create stations"
- **Cause**: Current user lacks super_admin role
- **Solution**: Login as super admin or request super admin to create

### Error: "Cannot delete station with active data"
- **Cause**: Station has active bookings or assigned users
- **Solution**: 
  1. Complete/cancel active bookings
  2. Reassign users to other stations
  3. Then delete, or use `force=true` (super admin)

### Error: "Station not found"
- **Cause**: Invalid station ID or station was deleted
- **Solution**: Verify station ID, check if station exists via GET /api/stations

### Error: "Access denied to this station"
- **Cause**: User trying to access station they're not assigned to
- **Solution**: 
  - Super admin: No restrictions
  - Station admin: Can only access assigned station
  - Request super admin to grant access

---

## üìù Notes

- Station codes are **immutable** once created (cannot be changed)
- Station codes are **unique** across the entire platform
- **Super admin** role required for most station management
- **Audit logs** track all station changes for compliance
- **Soft delete** not supported - deletions are permanent (with audit trail)
