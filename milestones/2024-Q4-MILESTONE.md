## 🏗️ Technical Debt Created

### Known Issues (Documented)

1. **No Rate Limiting:** API endpoints unrestricted (addressed Q1 2025)
2. **Basic Error Handling:** Limited error context (improved Q1 2025)
3. **No Caching:** Database queries not cached (added Q1 2025)
4. **Limited Testing:** Manual testing only (automated tests Q1 2025)
5. **Basic Monitoring:** No structured observability (added Q1 2025)

### Architectural Decisions

- **Monolithic Backend:** Single FastAPI app (appropriate for initial scale)
- **Synchronous Operations:** No async tasks (added Celery Q1 2025)
- **Simple Auth:** Basic JWT (enhanced with refresh rotation Q1 2025)

---

## 📈 Metrics

### Development

- **Code Lines:** ~15,000 lines (backend + frontend)
- **API Endpoints:** 25 endpoints
- **Database Tables:** 8 core tables
- **Migrations:** 12 alembic migrations

### Business

- **Features Delivered:** 5 major features
- **Uptime:** N/A (soft launch, no formal SLA)
- **Users:** Internal testing only

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Monorepo Structure:** Good separation of concerns
2. **TypeScript:** Caught many bugs early
3. **PostgreSQL:** Solid choice for complex queries
4. **FastAPI:** Rapid API development with good docs

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Testing:** Should have started with tests from day 1
2. **Monitoring:** Needed observability earlier
3. **Documentation:** Should document as we build
4. **Rate Limiting:** Security should be built-in from start

### Carryover to Q1 2025

- Implement comprehensive testing
- Add rate limiting and security hardening
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Improve documentation

## 🔮 Looking Ahead to Q1 2025

### Planned Features

1. **AI Chatbot Integration** (OpenAI GPT-4)
2. **Rate Limiting** (tier-based)
3. **Client-side Caching** (90%+ hit rate target)
4. **Automated Testing** (>80% coverage target)
5. **Performance Optimization** (database indexes, query hints)

### Technical Improvements

- TypeScript strict mode
- Environment variable validation
- Database connection pooling optimization
- Enhanced error handling
- Structured logging

## 📌 Key Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **PostgreSQL over MongoDB** | Complex relational data, ACID compliance needed | Positive: Excellent for bookings/invoices |
| **FastAPI over Flask** | Modern async support, automatic OpenAPI docs | Positive: Rapid development |
| **Monorepo Structure** | Shared types, unified deployment | Positive: Code reuse, consistency |
| **JWT Auth** | Stateless, scalable, standard | Positive: Good for API-first design |
| **Vercel for Frontend** | Automatic deployments, global CDN | Positive: Great DX, fast deploys |
