## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. ADMIN DASHBOARD USING MOCK DATA 🔴

**Location:** `apps/admin/src/app/page.tsx` (Line 46-91)

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Currently showing fake data:
const mockBookings: Booking[] = [
  { id: 'MH-1691234567890-ABC123', customerName: 'John Smith', ... }
];
setBookings(mockBookings);  // ❌ NOT REAL DATA
```

**Should be:**
```typescript
// Fetch real data:
const response = await fetch('/api/bookings/');
setBookings(response.data);  // ✅ REAL DATA
```

**Impact:**
- Admin cannot see actual bookings
- Stats calculated from fake data
- No business value from dashboard

**Fix Time:** 2 hours  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

### 2. ANALYTICS ENDPOINTS NOT USED 🔴

**Backend Ready (10 endpoints):**
```
GET /api/admin/analytics/overview       ✅ Working (returns revenue, conversions)
GET /api/admin/analytics/leads          ✅ Working (lead performance)
GET /api/admin/analytics/funnel         ✅ Working (conversion funnel)
GET /api/admin/analytics/lead-scoring   ✅ Working (lead quality)
GET /api/admin/analytics/engagement     ✅ Working (customer trends)
GET /api/admin/analytics/newsletter     ✅ Working (campaign stats)
GET /api/bookings/admin/kpis            ✅ Working (booking KPIs)
GET /api/admin/customer-analytics       ✅ Working (customer LTV)
GET /api/stripe/analytics/payments      ✅ Working (payment analytics)
```

**Frontend Status:**
- ❌ No `/admin/analytics` page exists
- ❌ Admin cannot view business metrics
- ❌ Cannot answer: "How much revenue this month?"
- ❌ Cannot track conversion rates
- ❌ Cannot see which campaigns work best

**Business Impact:**
- You've invested in building comprehensive analytics
- But admin has NO WAY to view this data
- Lost opportunity for data-driven decisions

**Fix Time:** 8 hours (create analytics page + connect charts)  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

### 3. CALENDAR SECURITY GAP 🔴

**Location:** `apps/backend/src/api/app/routers/booking_enhanced.py`

**Problem:**
```python
@router.get("/admin/weekly")
async def get_weekly_calendar(
    date_from: str,
    date_to: str,
    user=Depends(get_current_user)  # ⚠️ ANY authenticated user!
):
    ...
```

**Risk:**
- Non-admin staff can see ALL bookings
- Regular employees can access calendar across ALL stations
- No multi-tenant isolation

**Fix:**
```python
user=Depends(admin_required)  # ✅ Admin only
# OR
user=Depends(get_admin_user)  # ✅ Admin with station filter
```

**Fix Time:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

---

### 4. CUSTOMER FEATURES MISSING 🟡

**Available but Not Wired:**
1. **Customer Savings Display** - Component exists but not shown on main pages
2. **Booking History** - Backend ready but no customer portal page
3. **Invoice Download** - API endpoint exists but no UI

**Impact:** Customers don't see loyalty benefits

---

### 5. SOCIAL MEDIA UNDERUTILIZED 🟡

**Backend Has (17 endpoints):**
- ✅ Facebook/Instagram webhook integration
- ✅ Google Business Messages
- ✅ RingCentral SMS automation
- ✅ Yelp review ingestion
- ✅ Unified inbox with AI replies

**Frontend Missing:**
- ❌ No unified social dashboard

**Coverage:** 59% (10 out of 17 endpoints used)
