### **Found & Fixed Additional Issues:**

---

## 🎯 **QUOTE INTEGRATION IMPROVEMENTS**

### **1. CTA Redirects Fixed**

**Issue Found**: Quote-related CTAs were pointing to `/contact`
instead of the dedicated `/quote` page

**Fixes Applied:**

#### **Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`):**

- ✅ **Fixed**: `💬 Get a Quick Quote` now points to `/quote` (was
  `/contact`)

#### **Menu Page (`src/app/menu/page.tsx`):**

- ✅ **Enhanced**: Added 3-button layout:
  - `📅 Ready to Plan Your Date?` → `/BookUs`
  - `💰 Get Your Quote` → `/quote` (NEW)
  - `💬 Questions? Contact Us` → `/contact`
- ✅ **Updated**: Travel info now says "get your quote instantly
  above!"

## 🤖 **CHATBOT QUOTE FUNCTIONALITY ENHANCED**

### **Assistant API Improvements (`src/app/api/assistant/route.ts`):**

**Added Quote Handler:**

```typescript
if (message.includes('quote') || message.includes('pricing') || message.includes('how much')) {
  answer = "💰 Get an instant quote! Our hibachi experiences start at $55/adult and $30/child.
           Use our quote calculator to see exact pricing for your party size, location, and upgrades!"
  citations = [
    { title: 'Get Instant Quote Calculator', href: '/quote' },
    { title: 'View Full Menu & Pricing', href: '/menu' }
  ]
}
```

**Enhanced Price Detection:**

- Now triggers on: "quote", "pricing", "cost", "how much", "price"
- Auto-adds quote calculator link to any price-related responses

### **Chat Suggestions Updated (`src/components/chat/Assistant.tsx`):**

**New Quote-Focused Suggestions:**

- `/BookUs`: "How much will my party cost?"
- `/menu`: "Get a quote for my event"
- `/faqs`: "How much does hibachi catering cost?"
- `/quote`: Added dedicated suggestions:
  - "What's included in the base price?"
  - "Do you charge travel fees?"
  - "How do I book after getting a quote?"
