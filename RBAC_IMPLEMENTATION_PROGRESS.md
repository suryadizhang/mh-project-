## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### Phase 1: Database Schema (3 migrations, 345 lines)

#### 1.1 Audit Logs Table ✅
**File:** `006_create_audit_logs_system.py` (150 lines)

**Created:**
- `audit_logs` table with comprehensive schema
- 8 high-performance indexes
- `audit_action` enum (VIEW, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
- `user_role` enum (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, CUSTOMER_SUPPORT, STATION_MANAGER)
- `delete_must_have_reason` constraint (min 10 chars)

**Schema Fields:**
```sql
-- WHO
user_id, user_role, user_name, user_email

-- WHAT
action, resource_type, resource_id, resource_name

-- WHEN
created_at (timestamp)

-- WHERE
ip_address, user_agent, station_id

-- WHY
delete_reason (required for DELETE)

-- DETAILS
old_values (JSONB), new_values (JSONB), metadata (JSONB)
```

**Indexes Created:**
1. `idx_audit_logs_user_id` - Fast user lookups
2. `idx_audit_logs_resource` - Fast resource lookups
3. `idx_audit_logs_action` - Filter by action type
4. `idx_audit_logs_created_at` - Date range queries
5. `idx_audit_logs_station_id` - Station-specific queries
6. `idx_audit_logs_user_role` - Role-based queries
7. `idx_audit_logs_user_created` - Composite (user + date)
8. `idx_audit_logs_resource_action` - Composite (resource + action)

---

#### 1.2 Soft Delete Support ✅
**File:** `007_add_soft_delete_support.py` (85 lines)

**Modified Tables:**
- `bookings`
- `customers`
- `leads`
- `reviews`

**Added Columns per Table:**
1. `deleted_at` (timestamp) - NULL = active, NOT NULL = deleted
2. `deleted_by` (UUID) - User who performed deletion
3. `delete_reason` (text) - Mandatory reason for deletion

**Indexes Created (per table):**
- Partial index for active records: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` (ultra-fast)
- Index for deleted records: `WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL` (trash view)

**Total Indexes:** 8 (2 per table × 4 tables)

**Features:**
- 30-day restore window
- Soft delete by default
- Auto-purge after 30 days (configurable)
- GDPR compliance (right to erasure)

---

#### 1.3 User Roles ✅
**File:** `008_add_user_roles.py` (110 lines)

**Modified Table:** `users`

**Added Columns:**
1. `role` (user_role enum) - 4-tier role system
2. `assigned_station_id` (UUID) - For STATION_MANAGER role

**Role Hierarchy:**
```
Level 4: SUPER_ADMIN - Full system access
Level 3: ADMIN - Most operations, cannot manage admins
Level 2: CUSTOMER_SUPPORT - Customer-facing operations
Level 1: STATION_MANAGER - Station-specific operations
```

**Migration Logic:**
- Migrated existing users based on `is_admin` flag
- Set SUPER_ADMIN for specific emails (configurable)
- Set ADMIN for `is_admin = true` users
- Set CUSTOMER_SUPPORT as default for remaining users

**Indexes Created:**
1. `idx_users_role` - Fast role-based queries
2. `idx_users_station_manager` - Station manager lookups

---

### Phase 2.1: AuditLogger Service ✅
**File:** `core/audit_logger.py` (450 lines)

**Class:** `AuditLogger`

**Methods:**

1. **`log()`** - Generic logging method
   - Validates action type (VIEW/CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
   - Validates delete reason (10-500 chars for DELETE)
   - Captures full context (WHO/WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/WHY)
   - Returns audit log ID

2. **`log_view()`** - Log VIEW actions
   - Use for viewing sensitive data (PII, financials)
   - Example: Customer profile view, financial report view

3. **`log_create()`** - Log CREATE actions
   - Captures new resource state
   - Example: New booking, new customer, new lead

4. **`log_update()`** - Log UPDATE actions
   - Captures old and new values
   - Enables diff comparison
   - Example: Edit booking, update customer info

5. **`log_delete()`** - Log DELETE actions
   - **Requires mandatory delete_reason**
   - Validates reason length (10-500 chars)
   - Captures final state before deletion
   - Example: Delete booking, delete customer

6. **`get_logs()`** - Query audit logs
   - Filter by: user, action, resource, station, date range
   - Pagination support
   - Returns list of audit log dictionaries

**Features:**
- Automatic IP address capture
- User agent logging
- Station context tracking
- Metadata support (custom JSON)
- Comprehensive logging (structured)
- Database session management

**Validation:**
- Action must be in VALID_ACTIONS set
- Delete reason required for DELETE (min 10 chars)
- User must have id and role fields
- All required fields validated

**Usage Example:**
```python
from core.audit_logger import audit_logger

await audit_logger.log_delete(
    session=db,
    user=current_user,
    resource_type="booking",
    resource_id=booking_id,
    resource_name=f"{booking.customer_name} - {booking.booking_date}",
    delete_reason="Customer requested cancellation due to weather",
    old_values=booking.to_dict(),
    ip_address=request.client.host,
    station_id=booking.station_id
)
```

## 💡 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete Booking with Audit Trail

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from core.audit_logger import audit_logger
from api.app.utils.auth import require_customer_support

router = APIRouter()

class DeleteBookingRequest(BaseModel):
    reason: str = Field(..., min_length=10, max_length=500)

@router.delete("/bookings/{booking_id}")
async def delete_booking(
    booking_id: str,
    request_body: DeleteBookingRequest,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_customer_support()),
):
    # Fetch booking
    booking = await get_booking(db, booking_id)
    if not booking:
        raise HTTPException(404, "Booking not found")
    
    # Store old values for audit
    old_values = {
        "customer_name": booking.customer_name,
        "booking_date": str(booking.booking_date),
        "total_amount": float(booking.total_amount),
    }
    
    # Soft delete
    booking.deleted_at = datetime.utcnow()
    booking.deleted_by = current_user["id"]
    booking.delete_reason = request_body.reason
    await db.commit()
    
    # Audit log
    await audit_logger.log_delete(
        session=db,
        user=current_user,
        resource_type="booking",
        resource_id=booking_id,
        resource_name=f"{booking.customer_name} - {booking.booking_date}",
        delete_reason=request_body.reason,
        old_values=old_values,
        station_id=booking.station_id
    )
    
    return {"success": True, "message": "Booking deleted"}
```

### Example 2: Role-Based Access in Existing Endpoints

```python
# Before (no role check)
@router.get("/admin/bookings")
async def get_bookings(
    current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Any authenticated user can access
    ...

# After (with role check)
@router.get("/admin/bookings")
async def get_bookings(
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_customer_support())
):
    # Only SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, or CUSTOMER_SUPPORT
    ...
```

### Example 3: Station-Specific Access

```python
from api.app.utils.auth import can_access_station, UserRole

@router.get("/bookings")
async def get_bookings(
    station_id: Optional[str] = None,
    current_user: dict = Depends(require_any_admin())
):
    # STATION_MANAGER can only see their assigned station
    if current_user["role"] == UserRole.STATION_MANAGER.value:
        assigned_station = current_user["assigned_station_id"]
        if station_id and station_id != assigned_station:
            raise HTTPException(403, "Can only access your assigned station")
        station_id = assigned_station
    
    # SUPER_ADMIN and ADMIN can see all stations
    bookings = await get_bookings_by_station(db, station_id)
    return bookings
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Run Migrations
```bash
cd apps/backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 2: Verify Database
```sql
-- Check audit_logs table
SELECT * FROM audit_logs LIMIT 1;

-- Check user roles
SELECT id, email, role, assigned_station_id FROM users;

-- Check soft delete columns
SELECT deleted_at, deleted_by, delete_reason FROM bookings WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Step 3: Update Super Admin Emails
Edit `008_add_user_roles.py` before running migration:
```python
# Set SUPER_ADMIN for specific emails
op.execute("""
    UPDATE users 
    SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
    WHERE email IN (
        'admin@myhibachi.com',    # ← UPDATE THIS
        'owner@myhibachi.com',    # ← UPDATE THIS
        'superadmin@myhibachi.com' # ← UPDATE THIS
    )
""")
```

### Step 4: Test RBAC
```python
# Test role-based access
from api.app.utils.auth import require_customer_support, has_permission

# Test in endpoint
@router.get("/test-rbac")
async def test_rbac(user: dict = Depends(require_customer_support())):
    return {"role": user["role"], "access": "granted"}
```
