"""
Query optimization utilities for PostgreSQL.

This module provides utilities for:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries
- Query hints and optimizations
- Efficient aggregation queries
- Dashboard and analytics optimizations

Key Features:
- CTE-based queries for better query planning
- Index hints for PostgreSQL
- Materialized CTEs for performance
- Optimized joins and aggregations

Performance Targets:
- Dashboard queries: 200ms → 10ms (20x faster)
- Analytics queries: 500ms → 25ms (20x faster)
- Complex aggregations: O(n) → O(log n) with indexes
