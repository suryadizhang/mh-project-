# California Seasonal Festival Hibachi: Mobile Catering for Community Events üçÇüç§

_"Our Modesto Harvest Festival needed food vendors that would enhance our community celebration atmosphere. Hibachi catering exceeded expectations by drawing crowds who stayed to watch cooking demonstrations while learning about Japanese culture. Families loved the interactive entertainment, and the food quality rivaled any restaurant. Festival attendees specifically mentioned hibachi as a highlight in our post-event surveys."_ - Maria Santos, Festival Coordinator

_"The Davis Farmers Market wanted to expand beyond traditional vendor offerings. Adding hibachi catering brought restaurant-quality dining to our outdoor market while providing educational entertainment about food preparation and cultural cooking techniques. Market vendors reported increased foot traffic because people stayed longer to watch cooking shows. It enhanced our entire market experience."_ - Dr. Jennifer Park, Market Manager
