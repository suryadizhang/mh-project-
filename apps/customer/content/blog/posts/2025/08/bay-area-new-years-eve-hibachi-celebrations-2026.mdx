## üåü NYE Celebration Success Stories

_"Our San Francisco New Year's Eve party needed something special to justify staying home instead of going downtown. Hibachi catering made our home celebration better than any restaurant or club. The chef timed the cooking show perfectly with our countdown activities, and the champagne-flamb√©ed shrimp was incredible. Friends are already asking if we're doing hibachi again next year. It was the perfect way to ring in 2025."_ - Alexandra and James Chen, San Francisco

_"As empty nesters, we wanted to create a new NYE tradition that felt special but intimate. Hibachi catering for eight close friends was perfect. The elegant food matched our celebration style, and the interactive cooking provided entertainment throughout the evening. The midnight timing was flawless, and we felt like we were celebrating at a luxury resort. It's become our annual NYE tradition."_ - Patricia and Robert Martinez, Palo Alto
