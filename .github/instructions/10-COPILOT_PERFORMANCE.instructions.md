## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides guidelines for Copilot Agent to work
efficiently in the My Hibachi monorepo.

## 🚀 Performance-Optimized Search Strategy

### 1. Know Where to Look

| Looking For         | Search In                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Frontend components | `apps/customer/src/`, `apps/admin/src/` |
| API endpoints       | `apps/backend/src/routers/`             |
| Business logic      | `apps/backend/src/services/`            |
| Database models     | `apps/backend/src/db/models/`           |
| Shared types        | `packages/types/`                       |
| Tests               | `**/tests/`, `**/__tests__/`, `e2e/`    |
| Documentation       | `docs/`, `.github/instructions/`        |

### 2. Avoid Searching In

These folders are large and contain generated/vendored code:

- `node_modules/` – npm packages
- `.next/` – Next.js build output
- `.venv/` – Python virtual environment
- `dist/` – Build output
- `coverage/` – Test coverage reports
- `__pycache__/` – Python bytecode
- `archives/` – Obsolete documentation

### 3. Use Targeted Queries

```
# Good - specific path
grep_search with includePattern="apps/backend/src/services/**"

# Bad - searches everything
grep_search without includePattern
```

---

## 📖 Context Gathering Efficiency

### Read Large Chunks

Instead of many small reads:

```
# Preferred - one large read
read_file lines 1-200

# Avoid - many small reads
read_file lines 1-20
read_file lines 21-40
read_file lines 41-60
...
```

### Use Parallel Reads When Possible

When files are independent, read them in parallel:

```
# Good - parallel independent reads
read_file(fileA)
read_file(fileB)
read_file(fileC)

# Not needed - waiting between independent reads
read_file(fileA)
wait
read_file(fileB)
wait
```

---

## 🗂️ File Modification Guidelines

### 1. Fix Existing Files (No Duplicates)

From Core Principles Rule 7:

> **Fix existing files** instead of creating new duplicates. Before
> creating any file, check if similar exists.

### 2. Use Targeted Edits

For small changes, use `replace_string_in_file` with sufficient
context (3+ lines before and after).

### 3. Batch Related Edits

When making multiple related changes, use
`multi_replace_string_in_file` to apply them in a single operation.

## ⚡ Quick Reference Commands

### Find Files

```
file_search "**/*.py" - Find Python files
file_search "**/test_*.py" - Find Python tests
file_search "**/page.tsx" - Find Next.js pages
```

### Search Code

```
grep_search "def booking" includePattern="apps/backend/**"
grep_search "useBooking" includePattern="apps/customer/**"
semantic_search "payment processing logic"
```

### Get Context

```
list_dir "apps/backend/src/services"
read_file "apps/backend/src/services/booking_service.py" 1-300
```

---

## 🎯 Task Prioritization

When working on tasks:

1. **Understand scope first** – Read relevant files before editing
2. **Check batch context** – See `CURRENT_BATCH_STATUS.md`
3. **Verify dependencies** – Check imports resolve correctly
4. **Test locally before PR** – Run tests before pushing
